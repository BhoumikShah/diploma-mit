Initial Sequence:** 7, 3, 5, 1, 9, 8, 4, 6

**1st Iteration:**
1. **Key:** 3 (starts from the second element)
   - Compare with 7 (first element).
   - Since 3 < 7, swap 3 and 7.
   - Sequence becomes: 3, 7, 5, 1, 9, 8, 4, 6

2. **Key:** 5
   - Compare with 7 (previous element).
   - Since 5 < 7, swap 5 and 7.
   - Sequence becomes: 3, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8, 4, 6

3. **Key:** 1
   - Compare with 7, 5, 3 (previous elements).
   - Since 1 < 3, swap 1 and 3.
   - Since 1 < 5, swap 1 and 5.
   - Since 1 < 7, swap 1 and 7.
   - Sequence becomes: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8, 4, 6

... and so on until the end of the list.

**Intermediate Sequence after 1st Iteration:** 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8, 4, 6

**2nd Iteration:**
1. **Key:** 8 (starts from the third element)
   - Compare with 9 (previous element).
   - Since 8 < 9, swap 8 and 9.
   - Sequence becomes: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 4, 6

2. **Key:** 4
   - Compare with 9, 8, 7, 5, 3, 1 (previous elements).
   - Since 4 < 1, swap 4 and 1.
   - Since 4 < 3, swap 4 and 3.
   - Since 4 < 5, swap 4 and 5.
   - Since 4 < 7, swap 4 and 7.
   - Since 4 < 8, swap 4 and 8.
   - Sequence becomes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6

... and so on until the end of the list.

**Final Sequence after 2nd Iteration:** 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6

Therefore, after the 2nd iteration, the sequence is 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6.
